### What is this repository for? ###

* Reverse Engineering Arahne Weave files

### Inspiration ###

I have been trying to manupilate the used files for too long now, and this is my first attempt that shows a good potential.

I have learned Python throuhg my latest project CCTV_MOTION_TRACKING and i 
am trying to used my latest experience into this project.

Reverse Engineering is a process that takes a whole lot of time. i normally go on and off into this project. I have very slight knowledge on reverse engineering. But i think now i have the appropriate amount of info to give it a real try.

### About Arahne Weave ###

Arahne Weave is a Sweden software that allow designers to convert thier weave designs into files that can easily be read by weaving machinery. The process of exporting the files takes too long to build, so im tryiung to find a way to automate some changes in the exported files.

This project is not meant as a way to overcome the software license or so. I highly encourage users to buy the license. However, i am trying to build a way to automate processes to make this process much faster.


### What knowledge i have ###

* machine files are binary files
* i am trying to understand the files through exporting many files and testing them
* i am using this project to manupilate the files and try to display thier info in a slightly more friendly way


### Message to the reader ###

This is my message when i succeed (I hope so)


### External Tools Used ###

* WinMerge
* VSCode
